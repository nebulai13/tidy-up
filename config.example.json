/*
 * MacCleaner Configuration File
 * 
 * This file is loaded from:
 * ~/Library/Application Support/MacCleaner/config.json
 * 
 * Configuration Options:
 * 
 * storagePath (string)
 *   Path to your archive/storage drive (usually HDD)
 *   Files moved here are organized by date: YYYY/MM/
 *   Example: "/Volumes/storage1/" or "/Volumes/MyBackup/"
 * 
 * fastStoragePath (string)
 *   Path to your fast storage drive (usually NVMe SSD)
 *   For frequently accessed files you want kept on fast storage
 *   Example: "/Volumes/flash1/" or "/Volumes/MySSD/"
 * 
 * defaultThreshold (integer)
 *   Default minimum file size in MB to report during scans
 *   Can be overridden with --threshold flag
 *   Recommended: 100-500 depending on your storage situation
 * 
 * excludePaths (array of strings)
 *   Paths to skip during scanning
 *   System paths are excluded by default for safety
 *   Add your own paths to skip (e.g., Photos library)
 *   Examples:
 *     - "~/Library/Photos" - Skip Photos library
 *     - "~/Library/Developer" - Skip Xcode data
 *     - "/Volumes/TimeMachine" - Skip backup drive
 * 
 * autoArchiveOldFiles (boolean)
 *   Future feature: Automatically archive files older than threshold
 *   Currently not implemented, set to false
 * 
 * archiveOlderThanDays (integer)
 *   When autoArchiveOldFiles is true, files older than this will auto-archive
 *   Currently not used
 * 
 * To edit this file:
 *   1. Via CLI: maccleaner config --storage-path "/new/path/"
 *   2. Directly: open ~/Library/Application\ Support/MacCleaner/config.json
 *   3. Reset: maccleaner config --reset
 * 
 * After editing, verify:
 *   maccleaner config --show
